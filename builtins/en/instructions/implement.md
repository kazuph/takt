Implement according to the plan.
Refer only to files within the Report Directory shown in the Piece Context. Do not search or reference other report directories.

**Important**: Add unit tests alongside the implementation.
- Add unit tests for newly created classes and functions
- Update relevant tests when modifying existing code
- Test file placement: follow the project's conventions
- Running tests is mandatory. After completing implementation, always run tests and verify results
