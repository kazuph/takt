**This is AI Review iteration #{movement_iteration}.**

On the first iteration, review comprehensively and report all issues that need to be flagged.
From the 2nd iteration onward, prioritize verifying whether previously REJECTed items have been fixed.

Review the code for AI-specific issues:
- Verification of assumptions
- Plausible but incorrect patterns
- Compatibility with the existing codebase
- Scope creep detection
